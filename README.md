# FfmpegApi

A simple wrapper for using FFmpeg within .Net Applications.

## Why?

FFmpeg is a swiss army knife when it comes to media encoding/transcoding/decoding.  It is primarily driven by command line calls, which may not be what you want to write out all the time while trying to make use of it.  This simple API's goal is to simplify the use of FFmpeg within a .Net application.

## Requirements

1. [FFmpeg](https://FFmpeg.org/download.html)
2. .Net 4.6
